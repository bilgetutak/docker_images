Just a trial of creating a docker image for the use of pyroms from Kate Hedstrom and the dependencies explained on the page:

https://github.com/ESMG/pyroms

- It is miniconda based.
- Python packages are installed to the image using conda.
- Based on the official ubuntu latest image.

Not guaranteed to function correctly!

Use at your own risk

Dockerfile for the image creation is given at github:
